## The Ultimate Horace Heracy Reading Order

### Preface

The Horus Heresy is an experience unlike any other. For readers who can get their teeth into the setting, narrative and themes there's near 1000 hours of content. Not all of it is good - but the average quality is high enough that there's a dedicated audience of fans who consume and reconsume the series just to marvel at the depth and bredth of story covered over the hundreds of tales contained within. Producing 70 full length novels on a single coherent story and universe, not counting the numerous forms of complimentary media, was a really ambitious undertaking - while I do believe that most fans would argue that Games Workshop were more successful than they have any right to be, entrants into the series should be warned that HH's timeline is scattered and the order in which its content was released does not always follow in the order in which events occur. 

This presents a unique challenge to newcomers and rereaders alike, you have to choose how you want to order the series to consume in it a structured manner. Much like ordering the songs in an album, there's not necessarily a right way to do this. Most (I assume) would agree that following a chronological order of events helps make sense of the universe's timeline. But then, multiple storylines are occurring simultaneously. You can read the storylines in a coherent manner and map them on a timeline, but events that happen in the middle of one storyline do effect the core flow of other storylines. Some characters hop between storylines. Games Workshop, essentially, have written a concurrency problem. 

Less prosaic (if you'll excuse the pun) problems emerge from this organisation as well. Yes the appeal of the series is in large part reconstructing the astounding scale of its narrative - but there's more to storytelling than listing events in the order that they occur. If one was to follow a strictly narrative-chronological reading order they may find swapping between the themes central to each storyline dischordant, or that their attachment to characters suffer from hopping in and out of their context. Perhaps a more dedicated author could construct a reading order where one swaps book chapter by chapter for an optimal reading experience. Confounding our audit further is the mixed quality of the novels we seek to order. Some entries into the set have interesting consequences for the narrative but aren't considered very good books. From experience, slogging through a lesser entry in the series disrupts the core appeal of the series - a narrative flow that easily lasts months. That's not desireable either.    

No attempt to construct a reading order for the Horus Heresy will ever be definitive. There's a graph drafted by the community and published by games workshop that you can use to plot your own course if you're interested. I am by no means the final, or even a particularly good authority on this series. But I would be delighted to see more people share in this confusing, complex, and wonderful experience. Reading through this series a couple of times has been a special, engaging, and totally unique experience that I would strongly recommend to anyone with an interest. In the hope that I can convince someone to give it a go I've compiled my own recommendation for a path through the series that you might find to your taste. In many places it follows release order, in other places it differs substantially. It is, by design, opinionated - and I will be excluding books and storylines that I don't think pass muster. 

Just to mention so I don't have to explain later, I've been accused by friends of grading things weirdly. To set expectations, in my mind, a 9/10 must be essentially as perfect as it's possible to be. An irreplacable experience that's an instant firm recommend. Many of my favourite things pieces of media in the world are admittedly like 8.5/10 at best. I'm gonna be holding to my guns in these reviews. Anything over a 7 is recommended, anything under a 6 isn't worth your time unless you're like, a super fan, and I'll be flaming it.

With regards to an outline for what the whole series looks like, Horus Heresy has some really strong content from the start but taken all together it is a slow burn. There are several interesting, worthwhile novels that just aren't that gripping when compared to later entries in the series. If you're worried because you've skipped a few books in the first 20-30 don't be. Take it at your own pace and read what you want, this is just a guide. Getting into the thick of action is worth it whatever route you take to get there. This list trends towards recommending more rather than less, but a more minimal path would also be appropriate. 

With those disclaimers out the way, for others opinions on the franchise, I would strongly recommend you check out the subreddit r/warhammer, youtubers Arbiter Ian and Lexicanum, the Warhammer Wiki, and the Spoiler Free Reading Order Graph. Forgive for any exclusions or errors, and please feel free to engage with this however you see fit.

### The Reading Order and Why:

### 1 - The Isstvan III & V Betrayal Storylines

1 - Horus Rising - Dan Abnett - Book 1

It's a great introduction to the setting. The vast majority of characters, Human and Astartes, play their roles well. Abnett has a literary knack  for succinct but vivid description and Horus Rising is certainly sufficient enough a book to grasp your attention. Needless to say, as the first book of the series it's highly recommended that you give it a read. Most people enjoy this book, I would bet that you will too. 8/10. Essential and engaging reading. 

2 - False Gods - Graham McNeill - Book 2

False Gods is also recommended reading, in part because it's an important part of the narrative and in part because it's an engaging book. If you find yourself bored by certain sections, particularly the astartesian perspectives in this one don't give up. I felt the same, but Horus remains interesting due to his importance if nothing else, and the human cast injects some well needed soul and human interest. False gods serves as an interesting reflection on the empire as it sits just on the cusp of Heresy. I do feel that Graham McNeill connects with some these characters and themes more than others, and we should be grateful for that. 7/10. Essential and interesting reading.

3 - Galaxy in Flames - Ben Counter - Book 3

The first half of Galaxy in Flames is something of a mess. There are a _lot_ of characters, and they're pretty much all essential to the plot. Fatigue set in for me on my first two reads as I struggled to keep up with the cast and come to terms with a relatively rapid change in tone amongst the Luna Wolves. I'm not sure how hard the second half hits if you haven't won your struggle with grapsing the cast. My partner on her read through claims it hit her pretty hard, and from my second read on I found that Galaxy in Flames became an absolute gut punch in its concluding chapters. Once you get through its difficulties, Galaxy in Flames is epic in scale, well fleshed out, and absolutely central to the narrative. It's a genuine nail-biter. 8.5/10. Read it.

4 - The Flight of the Eisenstein - James Swallow - Book 4

The Flight of the Eisenstein isn't essential for the plot, but I enjoy it well enough that I would recommend reading it. The warsinger plot is a stupid concession to Warhammer 40k's background in the 80s, the key villain of this book is a bore of a character. The protagonist will be important later, but spends a lot of this book as a pleasant but plain character. What pulls it back into recommended reading is the sudden injection of key human cast into the plot, the series' real warp sequence and the introduction of some of the warps' implications. The "Flight" of the Flight of the Eisenstein stands out.  7.5/10. Going on the read pile

5 - Fulgrim - Graham McNeill - Book 5

It's guady, camp, jolly, and eventually it's horrifying - if you can forgive McNeill's indulgence with the melodramatic human cast plot points - which are thematically justified, it's a mostly good time. Fabius and Lucius are great villains, but the astartes contribution to this book is so excessively boring that my partner actually skipped it on her read. This is a real shame because in the last third of the novel important things happen. My recommendation is to make liberal use of your free will and skip the parts you find dull. It has good bits, it has terrible bits, it has important bits. This is the first novel I'd argue that you should exercise caution with. I'll give it a 6.5/10 and encourage that you read it, but don't stress paying attention to it all.

### 3 - Legion (Single Novel)

6 - Legion - Dan Abnett - Book 7

We are now officially getting off the rails of the release order. Skip Book 6 - Descent of Angels. It's so boring that it makes we want to cry. I'm really sorry Mr.Scanlon, Dark Angels are just really boring.

Anyway, Book 7, Legion, is a solid spy drama and Imperial Army novel that introduces a few important characters and concepts and a space marine legion that you will want to understand for the rest of the story later on. It hasn't been outrageously entertaining to me in any of my reads, but I haven't felt compelled to skip it either. It's a little more raunchy, a little more human, and on balance it is somewhat narratively important. I don't have much more to say because it doesn't directly belong to a key storyline other than as pertains to one character, but as a sort-of episodic novel it's worth a read. 7/10.

### 4 - The Schism of Mars Storyline

6 - Mechanicum - Book 9

We're skipping Book 8, Battle for the Abyss. It's ok. Pretty forgettable. I found it kind of filler-y and I don't think it plays an important role in the plot - it is technically the first book in an important plotline later on, but even that plotline kind of disowns it and replaces it with more important and better books later on. Weird because Ben Counter's contributions to this series trend solid. Anyway. 

I would recommend that you read Book 9, Mechanicum. The 6 books you've read so far have given a nice introduction to many of the most important factions in the universe but really neglect one of the most important. 

Considered a separate but equal organ from the empire's inception, the Mechanicum have very real control over most of the empire's manufactory hubs and engineering resources. With a separate religion and culture and laws knowing about the Mechanicum and the role they play politically will set you up well for the rest of the series. That said, Mechanicum is a weird kind of book. 

The plot itself is... I find it uncompelling? Sometimes the characters don't come across amazingly either. It doesn't even, I feel, do justice to how cool the Mechanicum are. Yet, I did enjoy it on the first 2 of my 3 readthroughs. Aesthetically the Mechanicum are just.. Cool. Some of the characters are pretty engaging and I found the religious aspects of the mechanicum enticing. I should qualify all of this with the fact that I'm a huge AdMech fan so I might be glazing here but.. I would argue that if it's not a big financial burden on you it's probably worth giving it at least one read. Some people disagree but I think you should try it. I wouldn't be mad if you skipped it, but you might like it and it will help you understand the universe. 7/10. Probably read.  

### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

7 - A Thousand Sons - Book 12

We're starting to run into a bit of a problem with the ordering of this series now. We have unavoidably moved past the events of some of A Thousand Sons, but we still need to piece together what happens in the Sack of Propsero storyline to proceed meaningfully. In order to do so we are going to skip a few books:

Book 10 is an anthology with some merit but belongs much later in our order, Book 11 is another >nauseated emoji< Dark Angels book that you should ignore. 

  






### 5 - The Shadow Crusade Storyline

We're skipping Book 10 (Tales of Heresy - an anthology), Book 11 (Fallen Angels), Book 12 (A Thousand Sons) and Book 13 (Nemesis). We'll come back to the last two, but for now we'll move onto

7 - The First Heretic (Book 14)

Emperor forgive me, but I think the Horus Heresy itself is best understood when one has empathy for the insurgents and a grasp of the context in which they behave. The First Heretic charts the experiences of the word-bearers within the pre-heresy empire and explores their interactions with chaos. It's an essential read not only for an understanding of the forces of chaos and what drives man to embrace the warp, but also for the sake of the entire Shadow Crusade storyline which it preludes.

For the sake of keeping the Shadow Crusade storyline intact we are going to skip Books 15 (Prospero Burns), 16 (Age of Darkness - an anthology), 17 (The Outcast Dead), and 18 (Deliverence Lost)

8 - Know No Fear (Book 19)

I've read Know No Fear described as a dry book. I disagree. It's an essential book. Essential as a primary to Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines, critical for your enjoyment, and advisable because it's _extremely metal_. It captures a huge portion of what the warhammer universe in what feels like a few (416) short pages.

We're skipping ahead again, ignoring Books 20, 21, 22, and 23 to move to 

9 - Betrayer (Book 24)

The thing is, Aaron Dembski-Bowden only wrote 4 of the mainline Horus Heresy Novels, and I love every single one of them. If the deeply emotive and personal approach to the followers of chaos appealed to you in The First Heretic, you'll find that same flavour of character-driven misery and mania here. There are plenty of reasons why Betrayer is an important book for the plot, but I would commend it primarily for having some of the most memorable and gut wrenching moments in the series. 

With Betrayer read we're now free to investigate other plotlines again for a while.



### 6 - Tales of Heresy

Here's a really weird one. This is a Anthology of mostly poor short stories and one absolutely legendary one. Weirder yet, you don't really have to read this one right now? This is in a new category we're introducing called "read whenever". ===NOTE TO SELF: IGNORE THIS, RECOMMEND IT FOR AFTER MASTER OF MANKIND ===

53) *I feel like the writers got complacent in for the a couple of books around this time, technically Titandeath (Book 53) is really important but also I genuinely do not care. I don't like Titan combat so YMMV but I would read about this one on the wiki.*

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*
