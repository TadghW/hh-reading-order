## The Ultimate Horace Heracy Reading Order

### Preface

The Horus Heresy is an experience unlike any other. For readers who can get their teeth into the setting, narrative and themes there's near 1000 hours of content. Not all of it is good - but the average quality is high enough that there's a dedicated audience of fans who consume and reconsume the series just to marvel at the depth and bredth of story covered over the hundreds of tales contained within. Producing 70 full length novels on a single coherent story and universe, not counting the numerous forms of complimentary media, was a really ambitious undertaking - while I do believe that most fans would argue that Games Workshop were more successful than they have any right to be, entrants into the series should be warned that HH's timeline is scattered and the order in which its content was released does not always follow in the order in which events occur. 

This presents a unique challenge to newcomers and rereaders alike, you have to choose how you want to order the series to consume in it a structured manner. Much like ordering the songs in an album, there's not necessarily a right way to do this. Most (I assume) would agree that following a chronological order of events helps make sense of the universe's timeline. But then, multiple storylines are occurring simultaneously. You can read the storylines in a coherent manner and map them on a timeline, but events that happen in the middle of one storyline do effect the core flow of other storylines. Some characters hop between storylines. Games Workshop, essentially, have written a concurrency problem. 

Less prosaic (if you'll excuse the pun) problems emerge from this organisation as well. Yes the appeal of the series is in large part reconstructing the astounding scale of its narrative - but there's more to storytelling than listing events in the order that they occur. If one was to follow a strictly narrative-chronological reading order they may find swapping between the themes central to each storyline dischordant, or that their attachment to characters suffer from hopping in and out of their context. Perhaps a more dedicated author could construct a reading order where one swaps book chapter by chapter for an optimal reading experience. Confounding our audit further is the mixed quality of the novels we seek to order. Some entries into the set have interesting consequences for the narrative but aren't considered very good books. From experience, slogging through a lesser entry in the series disrupts the core appeal of the series - a narrative flow that easily lasts months. That's not desireable either.    

No attempt to construct a reading order for the Horus Heresy will ever be definitive. There's a graph drafted by the community and published by games workshop that you can use to plot your own course if you're interested. I am by no means the final, or even a particularly good authority on this series. But I would be delighted to see more people share in this confusing, complex, and wonderful experience. Reading through this series a couple of times has been a special, engaging, and totally unique experience that I would strongly recommend to anyone with an interest. In the hope that I can convince someone to give it a go I've compiled my own recommendation for a path through the series that you might find to your taste. In many places it follows release order, in other places it differs substantially. It is, by design, opinionated - and I will be excluding books and storylines that I don't think pass muster. 

Just to mention so I don't have to explain later, I've been accused by friends of grading things weirdly. To set expectations, in my mind, a 9/10 must be essentially as perfect as it's possible to be. An irreplacable experience that's an instant firm recommend. Many of my favourite things pieces of media in the world are admittedly like 8.5/10 at best. I'm gonna be holding to my guns in these reviews. Anything over a 7 is recommended, anything under a 5 isn't worth your time unless you're like, a super fan, and I'll be flaming it.

With regards to an outline for what the whole series looks like, Horus Heresy has some really strong content from the start but taken all together it is a slow burn. There are several interesting, worthwhile novels that just aren't that gripping when compared to later entries in the series. If you're worried because you've skipped a few books in the first 20-30 don't be. Take it at your own pace and read what you want, this is just a guide. Getting into the thick of action is worth it whatever route you take to get there. This list trends towards recommending more rather than less, but a more minimal path would also be appropriate. 

With those disclaimers out the way, for others opinions on the franchise, I would strongly recommend you check out the subreddit r/warhammer, youtubers Arbiter Ian and Lexicanum, the Warhammer Wiki, and the Spoiler Free Reading Order Graph. Forgive for any exclusions or errors, and please feel free to engage with this however you see fit.

### The Reading Order and Why:

### 1 - The Isstvan III & V Betrayal Storylines

Summary:

I could envision a reading order where you don't read through the Isstvan III & V novels - but I wouldn't recommend it. Unless you're willing to get very weird and wacky with your approach or know the material like the back of your hand, reading at least the first three of these novels is reccomended. More than that, the first four Horus Heresy novels are a combination of good and great books, and you'd be missing out without them. The fifth novel of this plotline? Well, it's readable. I would neither recommend nor condemn it, if you have the time and appetite reading it won't hurt your experience.

1 - Horus Rising - Dan Abnett - Book 1

By and large I find Horus Rising to be highly diverting in just about every chapter, Abnett does a great job of painting a space-opera style tableau of the expanding imperium complete with a transectional cast of characters but without bogging the reader down with unwelcome detail. It's plot and intrigue distilled, and amazingly much of the cast here will keep influencing the narrative in 60+ novels time. You're most likely going to enjoy this book a lot, and that's good because it's basically essential to read. 7.75/10. Read it.

2 - False Gods - Graham McNeill - Book 2

False Gods is an interesting reflection on the empire as it sits just on the cusp of Heresy, a good book, and worth a read - but doesn't score quite as highly as Horus Rising. Fortunately it's a temporary dip in score as the next book along is legendary. I feel that Flase Gods has a bit of what I'll call "the Astartes Conundrum". On the one hand, the Astartes are core characters in the universe and all of its plotlines - but on the other it's kind of hard to write essentially fearless supermen? Repeatedly in the series you'll find that there are 1 to 3 interesting Astartes per book and that past that point they're hard to give unique or compelling characters. Rationally, this is the inevitable consequence of having a clone army of supermen raised together living together to complete the same task - and it doesn't compromise most books in the series, but if you feel like there's something lacking there don't worry. The writers know this and put heart and soul into creating at least a few interesting Astartes and injecting their plotlines with interesting non-Astartes characters and political developments. False Gods is still pretty great at net, it grips me every time, and it's important reading anyways 7.25/10. Read it.

3 - Galaxy in Flames - Ben Counter - Book 3

The first half of Galaxy in Flames a brilliant book, my baby, and something of a hot mess. There are a _lot_ of characters, all of whom are important to the plot, but most of whom are similar to one another. Light fatigue set in for me for the first half of my first two reads as I struggled to keep up with tone change and factional dynamics amongst the Astartes. I can envision a world where if you're busy struggling with that the closing act of the novel doesn't hit so goddamn hard. My partner read Galaxy in Flames and was fucked up by the conclusion, but your milage may vary. For me, Galaxy in Flames is the first truly epic in scale Horus Heresy novel with unusually well layed out action sequences and a gut-wrenching, conclusion. Without this book you don't get the impact of the beginning of the Heresy, so it's both a great book. Even after all these books, I remember it fondly. 8.5/10. Give it a read.

4 - The Flight of the Eisenstein - James Swallow - Book 4

The Flight of the Eisenstein isn't really essential for grokking the plot of the Isstvan betrayals, but all the same I really enjoy it and think it adds a lot to a readthrough. The warsinger plot is a stupid concession to Warhammer 40k's goofy 80s ahh canon and the key villain of this book is honestly a bore - but the human cast, astartes protagonist, warp sequence, and nail biting conclusion make The Flight of the Eisenstein stand out to me as one of my favourite novels in the series. 7.75/10. Give it a read.

5 - Fulgrim - Graham McNeill - Book 5

It's guady, camp, jolly, and eventually it is legitimately a bit horrifying, so if you can forgive McNeill's indulgence in melodrama and slightly excessive, baroque, human plotlines it's an interesting addition to the saga. Fabius and Lucius are great villains, but lack depth. The Astartes components of this book are so excessively dull that my partner actually skipped it on her read. This is a real shame because in the last third of the novel important things happen that reveal things about the universe. If you are going to read this one, and you really don't have to, my recommendation is to make liberal use of your free will and skip the parts you don't like. Fulgrim has good bits, Fulgrim has boring bits, Fulgrim is moderately informative. Read if if you want, skim the wikipedia article if you don't. 5.5/10

### 3 - Legion (Single Novel)

We are now officially breaking with the release order! We're going to skip Book 6 - Descent of Angels - Mitchel Scanlon. I'm really sorry Mr.Scanlon, I read this book once and the fantasy vibes, the Dark Angels and the way they speak just really didn't appeal to me - felt a bit YA. Thankfully the Dark Angels just don't mean much to the Horus Heresy so I see no reason to recommend the book on. Scanlon actually puiblished an Astra Militarum novel for Black Library's 40k selection called "Fifteen Hours" that's supposed to be quite good. Dk what happened here. Anyway.

6 - Legion - Dan Abnett - Book 7

Read number 6, Legion, is a solid little spy drama / Imperial Army novel that introduces a few important characters, factions, and concepts. It's definitely not a mandatory read and those speedrunners amongst you, those who think they wouldn't be interested in the plot, or those who are trying and not enjoying it can feel free to read the wikipedia page to catch up, but it's a good little novel and I think you should read it. It fleshes out the Imperial Army, chain of command, and universe around the imperium. Hell, if nothing else, it's a cute spy novel. There are a few funny moments and the novel keeps it much more human, than the novels so far which I really appreciate - it's a breath of fresh air and it's a scene change after reading Astartes books back to back. 7/10

### 4 - The Schism of Mars Storyline

For read number 7 we're skipping another book, breezing past Book 8 - Battle for the Abyss - Ben Counter. I really don't know what happened here. This book was practically retconned by its own successors, which were written in almost in parallel to it? It's not a very good book either, so there's not really a reason I can see to recommend this to anyone. I'd be nicer, but Counter (who wrote Galaxy in Flames, which is currently the best rated book we've discussed) is such an obviously talented writer that I don't feel the need to hedge this one. This is a stump of a novel, ignore it.

6 - Mechanicum - Graham McNeill - Book 9

I can recommend Mechanicum, though! The 6 books you've read so far have flagrantly rejected one of the most important factions in the universe and it's time you rectify that. Considered a separate but equal organ to human organisational structure in 30k, the Mechanicum own most of the empire's engineering resources and manufactory hubs.Better than that, they're sick ass machine people who speak in binaric cant and will compulsively hardwire their brains to anything from a toaster to a planet. With a totally separate religion and culture and divergent laws from the Imperium and a large share of its resources, knowing about the Heresy and not knowing about the Mechanicum doesn't make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, the novels generally handwave the mechanicum outside of their capacity as individual characters within imperial / heretic forces, so Mechanicum is a very important book in the series. Unfortunately, Mechanicum is also kind of a weird book. 

The plot of this novel is uncompelling? Sometimes the characters don't come across amazingly either. It doesn't even, I feel, do justice to how cool the Mechanicum are. Yet, I did enjoy it on the first 2 of my 3 readthroughs. Aesthetically the Mechanicum are just.. Cool. Some of the characters are pretty engaging and I found the religious aspects of the mechanicum enticing. I should qualify all of this with the fact that I'm a huge AdMech fan so I might be glazing here but.. I would argue that if it's not a big financial burden on you it's probably worth giving it at least one read. Some people disagree but I think you should try it. I wouldn't be mad if you skipped it, but you might like it and it will help you understand the universe. 7/10. Worth a read for those trying to align all the pieces and people who really like toasters.  

### 6 - The Sack of Propsero Storyline

Book 10 - Tales of Heresy - written by an assemble of new and returning black library writers - is an anthology of short stories merit that has merit. I will recommend that you read it, but not right now. I feel it belongs later in the reading order. Book 11 - Fallen Angels - By Mike Lee is another Dark Angels book that on balance I think everyone but completionists should skip. Sorry Lee. It's not devoid of interest, but it is half repetitive combat scenes by volume and the other half is not interesting enough to merit sitting through that.

What is interesting, although it really has no right to be, is the story of the Sack of Propsero. Graham McNeil and Dan Abnett tackle the Thousand Sons and Space Wolves legions, their homeworlds, cultures, dispositions, uses, and places in the emperors plan and Imperium. Objectively, this is a hard task. The Thousand Sons and Space Wolves both appear in earlier work mostly as pastiches designed to appeal to fantasy tropes. Warlocks and werewolves. It is therefor, something of an undertaking to try and make those legions conform into the mould of a serious universe of serious seriousness that takes itself seriously. Despite that, both of these books are worth a read - with Prospero Burns in particular being one of my favourite books in the series. 


7 - A Thousand Sons - Graham McNeil -  Book 12
A Thousand Sons isn't a book that's going to keep you on edge for almost any of its runtime - and there are sections of the book that I struggle to describe as anything but boring - but when the slow burn gets rolling I feel A Thousand Sons offers a successful, deft characterisation of Magnus, his sons, and the realities of the warp. If you didn't want to read it, you could patch your understanding of events perfectly by reading the 40K wikipedia page for Magnus's Folly - but don't. If you have a genuine interest in how chaos manipulates core characters, why the strategic landscape of the heresy develops as it does, and wallowing in the grimdark of it all you owe it to yourself to read A Thousand Sons. Doing so won't just immerse you in core themes and develop your understanding of the universe, it will reward you - Magnus's character arc is engaging, and deeply satisfying, and the human rememberencer cast offer a drops of levity and human interest to keep you going. 7.25/10


A Thousand Sons on the other hand is definitely worth a read if you find the subject matter interesting. For the fans of the occult, for those who want a close look into the workings of the mechanisms of the warp - for devotees of change and practicioners and magic for good and ill - A Thousand Sons is recommended reading. That's not to say it comes recommended without qualification. On each read I do find it thematically compelling and highly additive to the rest of the saga, but I don't think it's a killer book. 
8 - Prospero Burns - Dan Abnett - Book 13

What an 






### 5 - The Shadow Crusade Storyline

We're skipping Book 10 (Tales of Heresy - an anthology), Book 11 (Fallen Angels), Book 12 (A Thousand Sons) and Book 13 (Nemesis). We'll come back to the last two, but for now we'll move onto

7 - The First Heretic (Book 14)

Emperor forgive me, but I think the Horus Heresy itself is best understood when one has empathy for the insurgents and a grasp of the context in which they behave. The First Heretic charts the experiences of the word-bearers within the pre-heresy empire and explores their interactions with chaos. It's an essential read not only for an understanding of the forces of chaos and what drives man to embrace the warp, but also for the sake of the entire Shadow Crusade storyline which it preludes.

For the sake of keeping the Shadow Crusade storyline intact we are going to skip Books 15 (Prospero Burns), 16 (Age of Darkness - an anthology), 17 (The Outcast Dead), and 18 (Deliverence Lost)

8 - Know No Fear (Book 19)

I've read Know No Fear described as a dry book. I disagree. It's an essential book. Essential as a primary to Roboute Guilliman and the Ultramarines, critical for your enjoyment, and advisable because it's _extremely metal_. It captures a huge portion of what the warhammer universe in what feels like a few (416) short pages.

We're skipping ahead again, ignoring Books 20, 21, 22, and 23 to move to 

9 - Betrayer (Book 24)

The thing is, Aaron Dembski-Bowden only wrote 4 of the mainline Horus Heresy Novels, and I love every single one of them. If the deeply emotive and personal approach to the followers of chaos appealed to you in The First Heretic, you'll find that same flavour of character-driven misery and mania here. There are plenty of reasons why Betrayer is an important book for the plot, but I would commend it primarily for having some of the most memorable and gut wrenching moments in the series. 

With Betrayer read we're now free to investigate other plotlines again for a while.



### 6 - Tales of Heresy

Here's a really weird one. This is a Anthology of mostly poor short stories and one absolutely legendary one. Weirder yet, you don't really have to read this one right now? This is in a new category we're introducing called "read whenever". ===NOTE TO SELF: IGNORE THIS, RECOMMEND IT FOR AFTER MASTER OF MANKIND ===

51) *I still don't actually know what happens in Slaves to Darkness (Book 51), but I'm also not particularly compelled to find out. I've tried it twice and have been bored to tears within an hour of starting every time. I guess you could read about it on the wiki. You might learn something.*
